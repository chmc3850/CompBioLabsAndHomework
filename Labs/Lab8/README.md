In this lab, we modified logistic growth model code to be a function that takes four inputs: r, K, g, and init.  
* r = the intrinsic growth rate
* K = the carrying capacity
* g = the total number of generations
* init = initial population size

This logistic growth function calculates the population growth based on your inputs, creates a graph of population abundance over time, returns and matrix of generations and their corresponding abundance, and writes the results to a csv.
