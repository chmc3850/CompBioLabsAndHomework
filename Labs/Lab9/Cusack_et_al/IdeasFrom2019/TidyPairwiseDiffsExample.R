# cross-tabulate to get count data:
counts <- as.data.frame(with(camData, table(Placement,Season,Station,Species)), stringsAsFactors = F)

# spread the data to enable pairwise comparisons by Placement:

### -------  Just for exploring ggplot, various commands below ------------- ###

# let's build a ggplot step by step, and see how it looks after each.  
# NOTE that some of these steps are intentially error-producing

# let's make a smaller example
dataToPlot <- subset(dataToPlot, Species == "Zebra" | Species == "Spotted hyena")

myPlot <- ggplot(data = dataToPlot)
myPlot # blank plot because NOTHING specifed yet about appearance
myPlot <- myPlot + geom_boxplot()
myPlot
# ERROR!  "stat_boxplot requires the following missing aesthetics: y"
# Let's start over.  We never specified an aesthetic!

myPlot <- ggplot(data = dataToPlot, mapping = aes(Season, Trail))
# note in the previous line: we can give ggplot a calculation to do!
# in this case, it was the subtraction
myPlot  # note this shows axes with NO data plotted?  Why?  Because we need
    # to specify a geom of some kind.  HOW are the data supposed to be shown?
myPlot <- myPlot + geom_boxplot()
myPlot # now we see all the data in just two boxes
myPlot <- myPlot + facet_wrap(facets = ~Species)
myPlot # now we see facets

## other options we could try:
ggplot(data = dataToPlot, mapping = aes(Season, Trail, color = Species)) + 
  geom_boxplot()
# now we see the same data but without facets.  Instead of facet_wrap(), we added one
# more dimension to the mapping argument specified with aes()


# what happens if we don't specify an x axis?  A boxplot doesn't actually 
# have to have one... 
myPlot <- ggplot(data = dataToPlot, mapping = aes(y = Trail, color = Season)) + 
  geom_boxplot() + 
  facet_wrap( ~Species, scales = "free")
myPlot
# But note that we get meaningless x axes ticks!
# Web search for "ggplot no ticks" revealed this solution:
# https://stackoverflow.com/questions/35090883/remove-all-of-x-axis-labels-in-ggplot#35090981 
myPlot + theme(axis.title.x=element_blank(),
      axis.text.x=element_blank(),
      axis.ticks.x=element_blank())
# for more on theme(), see https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/theme.html
# for more on element_blank(), see https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/element.html 

# to understand aes even a bit more, compare these three plots:

plot1 <- ggplot(data = dataToPlot, mapping = aes(x = Season, y = Trail, color = Season)) + 
  geom_boxplot() + 
  facet_wrap( ~Species )
plot1
# Season is used to separate data to be mapped into D and W, and they are 
# given different colors

ggplot(data = dataToPlot, mapping = aes(x = Season, y = Trail, color = "purple", fill = "gold")) + 
  geom_boxplot() + 
  facet_wrap( ~Species )
# the legend of the latter is complete nonsense!  Why?  Because the strings
# we gave for color and fill were INSIDE aes().  They don't correspond to data,
# but aes() is for creating a mapping of the data, not its colors per se

ggplot(data = dataToPlot, mapping = aes(x = Season, y = Trail)) + 
  geom_boxplot(color = "purple", fill = "gold") + 
  facet_wrap( ~Species )
# now colors are actually colors, because they are given as an option to 
# the geom_boxplot(), and are NOT inside the aes()

# and finally, note that the following two plots are identical:
plot1  # from a few lines above

ggplot(data = dataToPlot) + 
  geom_boxplot(mapping = aes(x = Season, y = Trail, color = Season)) + 
  facet_wrap( ~Species )
# sincde the boxplots are the only geom in this ggplot object, it doesn't matter
# whether the aesthetic is specified in the ggplot() call or in the
# geom_boxplot() call.  geom_boxplot() automatically (by default) "inherits"
# the aesthetic from the corresponding ggplot() call, if one has been specified


# and if you want to see some details of how R stores all this information:
typeof(plot1)
class(plot1)
str(plot1)

## Some examples that may help with lab 11:

dataToPlot <- subset(countsSpread, Species %in% top12)

dataToPlot$RminusT <- dataToPlot$Random - dataToPlot$Trail

# summarise by species averages:
avgDiffs <- summarise(group_by(dataToPlot, Species), 
                      meanDiff = mean(RminusT))
avgDiffs

# but why not have more info?
avgDiffs <- summarise(group_by(dataToPlot, Species), 
                      meanDiff = mean(RminusT), # mean
                      SDdiff = sd(RminusT),     # standard deviation
                      n = n())                  # sample size for each

# how about sorted in descending order of diffs?
avgDiffs <- arrange(avgDiffs, desc(meanDiff))
avgDiffs

### --------- BELOW is totally optional stuff for fun ----------###
### ---------------- "Piping" in the tidyverse -----------------###
# here's summarising in a tidy way with pipes:
avgDiffs <- dataToPlot %>%            # get the data, then
  group_by(Species) %>%               # group by species, then
  summarise(meanDiff = mean(RminusT), # summarise by mean,
            SDdiff = sd(RminusT),         # standard deviation, and
            n = n()) %>%                  # sample size for each, then
  arrange(desc(meanDiff))             # sort descending on meanDiff

avgDiffs

# use means and SDs for plot, just for fun:
ggplot( avgDiffs, aes(x = Species, y = meanDiff) ) + 
  geom_point() +
  geom_errorbar( aes(ymin = meanDiff - SDdiff, ymax = meanDiff + SDdiff)) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle=90, hjust = 1))
  

# Similar to the UNIX shell, pipes %>% in the tidyverse 
# make the output of one command become the "data" argument of 
# the following command.  That means you are usually "piping"
# a data frame (or similar rectangular object) from one
# command to the next
