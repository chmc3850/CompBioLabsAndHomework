# Distribution of Fungi Based on Habitat and Substrate

## Introduction

The study I have sourced my data from includes observations of 93 mushroom species in a Nigerian savannah. Mushrooms were observed two times per week and identified by various physical features. The authors used various statistical methods to determine the species composition and distribution of this area. My project will use the observational data from Buba et al. (2018) to analyze and visualize the mushroom distributions and plant-mushroom associations of the study area.

## Summary of Data to be Analyzed

### Goals of original study and methodology
The goal of the original study was to determine fungal species distributions for this Nigerian savannah, and ultimately use this information to propose strategies for conservation.
Forays were conducted two times per week. Mushroom specimens were collected and identified using various physical features. 

### Type of data  
The dataset is simply a CSV file with frequency counts for individual mushroom species based on substrate and microhabitat. Observational data from mushroom forays are used in this dataset. The data is relatively small at 19 kB, and includes 20-30 observations for each of the 93 different species. Although there is poor metadata and documentation, this dataset looks relatively straightforward and I don't see anything too problematic at this point.

## Detailed Description of Analysis to be Done and Challenges Involved

I will use various features of tidyr and ggplot to analyze and visualize the data from the study. This will be similar to the analysis done in the original study with some novel analyses too. I will reorganize and "reshape" the data to help better understand and visualize the distribution of certain species, much like the original study. I will also manipulate the data in order to determine plant-fungal relationships, something the original study did not touch on. Although the data is relatively limited, the analysis will be challenging since there are 28 possible categories for each of the 93 species. It will be an interesting test of my newly gained skills working with various functions in tidyr.
